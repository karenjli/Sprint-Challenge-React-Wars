1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.
React JS is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. React JS is preferable because 1) its syntax is similar to Vanila JS which is familiarized by a lot of developers and 2) it is not as JS heavy which can cause search engine failure.
1. What does it mean to think in react?
To think it react means to account for the state changes on each of the components on the page while writing the code. React allows state changes to happen without mutating the whole UI because state can be changed by functions. 

1. Describe props.
Components can be customized in React JS. To specify the parameters to be changed, props are used to refer to the original component and everything after the `.` is the customizable item.
1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?
Side effects are the impact of a component that happens outside of its scope. Sometimes, those effects could be unhelpful and therefore developers use useEffect() to gain full control of the effects of each component.
